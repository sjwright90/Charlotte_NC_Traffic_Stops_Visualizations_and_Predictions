This interactive app allows users to develop plots from a dataset of police stops in the City of Charlotte, NC. The app also hosts a decision tree classifier that predicts the outcome of a traffic stop given user inputs.

The work done here serves as how one might go about examining policing data and developing predictive models for policing data. The results of the predictive model are best used to demonstrate potential bias in policing in Charlotte, NC. Users should not infer that the model results be used to advising policing activity, rather the results are better used to illustrate how the results of a stop vary depending on the parameters of the traffic stop.

Thanks for reading now let's jump into some data processing!
