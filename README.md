 Visualizations and simple predictive models of Charlotte, NC police stop data

Credit for data attributed to: City of Charlotte, North Carolina:

City of Charlotte open data policy can be found [here](https://charlotte.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7c88b8633b034ddcbbd6badb1b7076fe)

An interactive app that allows users to develop plots of the dataset and hosts a decision tree classifier that predicts the outcome of a traffic stop given user inputs can be found here:  
[Charlotte Policing App](https://sjwright90-dsba5122-design-contest--home-page-b5jsbd.streamlit.app/)

The app is built in Streamlit and hosted on their server, if you are not familiar with Streamlit it is an amazing library and I suggest you go check it out.

The work done here serves as how one might go about examining policing data and developing predictive models for policing data. The results of the predictive model are best used to demonstrate potential bias in policing in Charlotte, NC. Users should not infer that the model results be used to advising policing activity, rather the results are better used to illustrate how the results of a stop vary depending on the parameters of the traffic stop.
