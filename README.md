The work done here serves as how one might go about examining policing data and developing predictive models for policing data. The results of the predictive model are best used to demonstrate inherent bias in policing in Charlotte, NC. Users should not infer that the model results be used to advising policing activity, rather the results are better used to illustrate how the results of a stop vary depending on the officer and driver demographics. Up front I note that the model has inherent bias, the intent of this project is to draw attention to that bias in the hopes of begining discussion around policing.
